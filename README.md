A super simple demo of a Pet Store coded using OOP.

This is not a robust program by any means. Input checking is particularly weak.
This was thrown together quickly, so parts of it are messy: that's on purpose.
This is meant to be used as a base for refactoring practice.
All classes involved have been combined into this one "PetStoreSimulator.java" file for convenience.
